# Community Service Information Page
This is my rough attempt at making my highschool's community service page not only be better looking (while maintaining its original looks) but also lets non-technical users to make modifications to the website using skeletonui and firebase.

# Features
- Responsive layout for every device
- Light & Dark theme
- Fetches all information from Firebase
- Admin page with authentication, sign up, and new activity uploads
